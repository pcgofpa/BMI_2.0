# BMI_2.0
### Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

<p>It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value. <br>
<ul>
    <li>Under 18.5 they are underweight</li>
    <li>Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight</li>
    <li>Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight</li>
    <li>Over 30 but below 35 they are obese</li>
    <li>Above 35 they are clinically obese.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>![Graph comparing Height vs Weight to determine if someone is a healthy weight.!](BMI_Formula.png)</p>
<p> The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):<br>
![BMI = weight(kg) over height squared](https://github.com/pcgofpa/BMI_2.0/blob/main/BMI_Graph.png)</p>
<p>Warning you should round the result to the nearest whole number.<br> The interpretation message needs to include the words in the list from the interpretations above.<br> e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.</p>
